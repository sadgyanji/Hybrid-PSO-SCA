# Hybrid-PSO-SCA
This is the proposed methodology by me to implement Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization with Sine Cosine Algorithm (HPSO-SCA) in order to perform Image segmentation operation in Real time.  

In this repository, I have uploaded the code along with the sample video on which I have tested this algorithm. The Ground truth mask folder could not be uploaded as its size is more than 25 mb therefore, I have uploaded the code to convert a normal video to grayscale and also, the code which captures each frame of video and save it in a folder.
